# Prose Writing Template

This is my open-source writing toolchain.
With this, I can write files in Markdown, track them in Git, and export them as `.docx` or `.pdf` files.

## Usage

Write some content in `my-essay.md` and then type

```bash
make
```

This will produce `my-essay.docx`, `my-essay.pdf`, and some intermediate files.

## Setup

Make sure you have the prerequisite tools installed:
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [Aspell](http://aspell.net/)
- [Proselint](https://github.com/amperser/proselint)
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
